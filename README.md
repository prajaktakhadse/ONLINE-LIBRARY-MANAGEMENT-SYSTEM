# ONLINE-LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
Library management system, any student can request during the issuance of a book. For registration, a request needs to be sent to admin and the account will get after verification. Here, the admin will act as a librarian and will have the authority to approve/reject any request. Whenever a student will request, permission will be provided from the librarianâ€™s end only. With the help of this PHP project, the management will be easy and all the tasks will be performed on a single platform and changes can be made in their account as per need. This simple library management system also offers:

 * Admin panel for the account and query handling that will be taken care of by the librarian
 * List of availability of books
 * To change/maintain the current records to eliminate any fuzziness
 * Due date reminder for students to avoid any penalty
